Description: Variable selection in high dimensional settings is 
    a task of key importance, particularly in the biomedical sciences. 
    This package implements methodology designed to perform:
    (i) variable selection, (ii) effect estimation, and (iii) uncertainty
    quantification, for high-dimensional survival data. Broadly, our 
    method uses a spike-and-slab prior with Laplace slab and Dirac spike 
    and approximates the corresponding posterior using variational 
    inference, a popular method in machine learning for scalable conditional
    inference. Although approximate, the variational posterior provides
    excellent point estimates and good control of the false discovery rate.
    The uncertainty quantification is not as good as MCMC, however compute
    times are orders of magintude faster.
